Installation:

1. Clone the repo.
2. npm install (will install the two required npm modules)
3. Edit index.js
3a. Set the IP address of the machine you will run server on
3b. Set IP address of your xbox one
3c. Get your Live ID. On your Xbox, go to Settings > System > Console info & updates and look under "Xbox Live device ID"
4. run server with npm start

Caveats:

Currently this will only turn the xbox ON, not off.
